## Upgrade Procedure

When upgrading Odoo version:
1. Test `stock_crude_oil_tank_restriction` — `button_validate` override must still work
2. Test `mrp_component_availability_check` — `_button_mark_done_sanity_checks` must still exist
3. Check all OCA module compatibility with new Odoo version on https://github.com/OCA
4. Check `om_*` modules for version compatibility
5. Run full manufacturing test (Test A and B from `docs/TESTING_GUIDE.md`) before go-live
