## Custom FamOil Modules (in custom_addons/)

### stock_crude_oil_tank_restriction
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Version | 17.0.1.1.0 |
| Purpose | Prevents non-Crude-Soya-Oil products from being transferred into Crude Oil Tank 1 or Tank 2 |
| Mechanism | Overrides `button_validate` on `stock.picking`; raises `UserError` on violation |
| Lookup strategy | Runtime name search — no hardcoded IDs |
| Override point | `stock.picking.button_validate()` |
| Upgrade risk | LOW — override is at validation level; test after any Odoo upgrade |
| Known conflicts | None |

### mrp_component_availability_check
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Version | current |
| Purpose | Blocks manufacturing order completion if component quantities are insufficient |
| Mechanism | Overrides `_button_mark_done_sanity_checks` on `mrp.production` |
| Override point | `mrp.production._button_mark_done_sanity_checks()` |
| Upgrade risk | MEDIUM — sanity check method may change across Odoo versions |
| Known conflicts | None |

### stock_landed_cost_po_check
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Version | 17.0.1.0.0 |
| Purpose | Blocks landed cost validation if any linked receipt was not created from a Purchase Order; schedules automated activity reminder on every validated SoyaBean receipt |
| Mechanism | Overrides `button_validate` on `stock.landed.cost`; raises `UserError` if `picking_type_code != 'incoming'` or `move_ids.filtered('purchase_line_id')` is empty. Automated action fires on `stock.picking` state → done to schedule a todo activity |
| Override point | `stock.landed.cost.button_validate()` |
| Depends | `stock_landed_costs`, `purchase_stock`, `base_automation`, `mail` |
| Decision | DEC-012 |
| Upgrade risk | LOW — constraint logic is simple; re-run 3-test suite after any Odoo upgrade |
| Known conflicts | None |

## Upgrade Procedure

When upgrading Odoo version:
1. Test `stock_crude_oil_tank_restriction` — `button_validate` override must still work
2. Test `mrp_component_availability_check` — `_button_mark_done_sanity_checks` must still exist
3. Test `stock_landed_cost_po_check` — run 3-test suite; verify `purchase_line_id` still exists on `stock.move`
4. Check all OCA module compatibility with new Odoo version on https://github.com/OCA
5. Check `om_*` modules for version compatibility
6. Run full manufacturing test (Test A and B from `docs/TESTING_GUIDE.md`) before go-live
